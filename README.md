This is a proof of concept Power App that was designed to be embedded within a SharePoint site/page. I created it as an alternative to the out of the box 'Events' Web Part for those that want event registration functionality and would like it to look as out of the box as possible. The use of a low code/no code Power App means there is no need for custom development.

The look and feel has been designed to replicate that of the out of the box Web Part.

The solution is functionally complete but is provided as a POC for you to customise/extend as required.
